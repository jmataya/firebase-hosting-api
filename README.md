# Firebase Hosting API

A really simple wrapper around Firebase Tools hosting capabilities for use when a
really traditional CI or other deployment tools won't work. The system lets you
define local directories where static files live, scripts to process the static
files before deployment, and finally endpoints to deploy and monitor results.

This is probably only useful for me, but putting it out there in case other
people find it to be useful.
